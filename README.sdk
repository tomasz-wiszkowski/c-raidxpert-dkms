These instructions apply to building __BR_shortName__ __BR_brandName__ drivers
on Linux systems.

It is possible to build the driver for many distributions based on Linux
version 3.10 and newer kernels without having the complete kernel source tree available.

Simply running the command 'make install' in the src/ directory with no
arguments will make the driver for the currently running kernel and install it.

To build and install the driver for a recently updated kernel before rebooting
into the new kernel version, use the KVERS make argument to override the kernel
version.  For example:

    make KVERS=3.10.0-862.el7.x86_64      	install      # Red Hat 7.5
    make KVERS=4.18.0-193.el8.x86_64      	install      # Red Hat 8.2
    make KVERS=4.18.0-240.el8.x86_64      	install      # Red Hat 8.3
    make KVERS=5.4.0.26-x86_64  			install      # Ubuntu 20.04


You can override both the kernel version and the location of the kernel objects
when doing the make for custom kernels or unsupported distributions.
For example:

    make KVERS=4.12.0.5 mykern install
    make KVERS=4.12.0.5-mykern KDIR=/test/lib/modules/4.12.0.5-mykern install

On supported Red Hat and Ubuntu systems, the "install" make target will run
the appropriate script that will complete the installation by updating module
configuration files and rebuilding the initrd image.

On unsupported systems, the driver modules will be copied to the scsi module
lib directory of the specified kernel and nothing else is done.  It is up to
the user to perform any additional steps (especially if booting off the
__BR_notm_brandName__ controller).  Additional steps that you may need to take
include:

        o run 'depmod -a'
        o make a new /boot/initrd-{KERNEL_VERSION}.img image that
          includes AMD-RAID drivers (typically with /sbin/mkinitrd)

Consult your system documentation for the exact steps necessary and the syntax
of the commands.
